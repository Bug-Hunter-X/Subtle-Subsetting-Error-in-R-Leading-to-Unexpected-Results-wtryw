# This code demonstrates the correct way to subset a data frame using a logical condition,
# resolving the issue highlighted in the bug report.

data <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 6:10)

# Correct subsetting
correct_subset <- data[data$x > 3 & data$y < 9, ]

# The solution is that the upper bound for 'y' needed to be adjusted to include the 8
# It is important to check each condition carefully and to understand the implications of using operators such as '&'.
# Additionally, using parentheses can increase readability and prevent issues with operator precedence.

# Example of using parentheses to improve readability
correct_subset <- data[(data$x > 3) & (data$y < 9), ]

print(correct_subset)
